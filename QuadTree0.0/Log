I have started reading the paper again. I am trying to remember the algorithm again before start writing it again. The Code that i have written till now is based on the old paper. I have to make some small changes and start working on it. I will also have to learn about parallel reduction techniques using Cuda. This i will learn by studying the other code, once i am done with my paper.
